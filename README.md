**Methodology & Technical Approach**

- Analyzed global and U.S. Work-From-Home (WFH), Hybrid, and Full Onsite work patterns using datasets from WFH Research
- Examined long-run trends spanning pre-COVID, COVID shock, and post-pandemic stabilization
- Cleaned and structured survey-based and aggregated datasets by:
    - Standardizing time formats and industry labels
    - Handling missing and inconsistent survey responses
    - Aligning multiple datasets for temporal and categorical comparison
- Conducted long-run trend analysis of work arrangements
- Identified a sharp pandemic-driven spike in WFH during 2020
- Observed post-2021 normalization with hybrid work stabilizing around ~30%
- Found full-remote work declining but remaining above pre-COVID baselines
- Performed industry-level analysis of WFH adoption
- Identified high-WFH industries:
    - Information
    - Finance & Insurance
    - Professional & Business Services
- Identified low-WFH industries:
    - Hospitality & Food Services
    - Retail
    - Transportation & Warehousing
- Applied clustering techniques to group industries into:
    - High WFH adoption (>35%)
    - Medium WFH adoption (20–35%)
    - Low WFH adoption (<20%)
- Highlighted structural differences based on job nature and digital feasibility
- Conducted city-level analysis across major U.S. metro areas
- Compared WFH trends in Bay Area, Chicagoland, Washington DC, and Los Angeles
- Observed consistent declines from 2020 peaks while remaining above pre-pandemic norms
- Analyzed employee preferences and micro-level factors using survey data
- Found WFH preference strongly associated with:
    - Better sleep
    - Improved work-life balance
    - Increased quality time
- Observed office-preferred workers reporting higher perceived structure but slightly higher stress
- Performed correlation analysis on WFH preference drivers
- Identified strongest correlations with:
    - Quality time (≈0.48)
    - Work-life balance (≈0.40)
    - Better sleep (≈0.38)
- Found demographic factors such as age to be less influential
- Conducted ROI and cost-benefit analysis across work models
- Compared real-estate costs, IT infrastructure, productivity, and employee satisfaction
- Identified Hybrid (≈50%) as the most cost-effective and balanced long-term model
- Implemented ARIMA-based time-series forecasting

Forecasted:
    - Full Remote stabilizing around 11–12%
    - Hybrid Work stabilizing around 26–27%
- Validated hybrid work as the dominant long-term organizational structure
-Developed advanced visualizations to support analysis:
    - Long-run trend plots
    - Industry and city comparison charts
    - Correlation heatmaps
    - Stacked work-arrangement distributions
    - Forecast plots with confidence intervals
- Consolidated findings into a structured analytical report emphasizing workforce strategy, productivity, cost optimization, and policy implications

**Technical Emphasis**
- Survey data preprocessing and validation
- Long-run trend and structural-shift analysis
- Industry and geographic segmentation
- Correlation analysis and clustering
- Time-series forecasting (ARIMA)
- Policy-driven data visualization and storytelling
